# CORS Anywhere

CORS Anywhere is a NodeJS proxy which adds CORS headers to the proxied request - <https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere>

I remove some packages, test code and upload it to my repo for self hosting
using `render.com ` to host the proxy API

- connect your github account and authorize with render
- next choose the repo you want to deploy in render
- add build command and start command to complete the setup
- done

```sh

## start the server

yarn start

```
